# todo-cli-summer18

A todo list for devs.  Create and manage a list of todo items for your software project.  Simply install the cli via npm (coming soon), run `todo init` and add your first todo item via `todo add drink coffee`.  Multiple todo lists can be created, one for each project directory. The todo list is stored within a **todos.json** file. 


## Install

The todo cli should be installed globally.  That way you can run it from any project directory on your local machine. 

```
npm install todo-cli-summer18 -g
```

## Create your first todo list

After installing the todo cli, you can move into your project directory and create your first todo list via the `todo init` command.  Remember, each directory can hold its own todo list. 

```
cd <your project directory>
todo init
```

## Create your first todo item

```
todo add drink coffee
```
